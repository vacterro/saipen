"""Run every executable conformance fixture and compare to its declaration.

Stdlib only. Run from the SAIPEN home:

    python tools/run_scenarios.py

`tests/scenarios/` holds two kinds of fixture. Behavioral ones are README-only
-- the assertion is about agent decision-making, which no script can judge --
and are skipped here. Structural ones ship a real `.saipen/` and declare the
outcome they expect on a line of their own README:

    expect: pass      the state is valid; tools/validate.py must exit 0
    expect: fail      the state carries the defect the fixture exists to
                      demonstrate; validate.py must exit non-zero

A fixture with a `.saipen/` and no `expect:` line is itself an error: an
un-declared fixture cannot be checked, and silently skipping it is how this
whole directory sat unexecuted for months (CONFORMANCE.md's "honest status"
note, v7.75.0).

After the state fixtures, both bootstrap injectors run against isolated homes
seeded with stale managed directories. The probe checks installed artifacts,
not script tokens, and carries a broken-layout red-control.

Exit code is non-zero if any fixture's real outcome differs from its
declaration, so CI fails on it like any other gate.
